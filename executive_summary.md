# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: VPN CHURN ANALYSIS

## The Problem
Proton VPN has a **40% churn rate**. An analysis of 100,000 customers identifies two controllable root causes.

## Root Causes (Statistically Validated)

**#1: Plan Type (Primary Driver)**
- Monthly plans: 61.6% churn vs Annual plans: 11.7% churn
- Current split: 56.8% monthly / 43.2% annual
- Monthly subscribers are **5.3x more likely to churn**

**#2: Early-Stage Attrition**
- Days 0-90: 54.1% churn vs After 90 days: 35% churn
- Customers who survive 3 months typically stay long-term

**#3: Seasonal Patterns (Minor)**
- Q2 (Spring): 46.7% churn vs Q4 (Winter): 33.5% churn

**What doesn't matter**: Usage hours, device count, support tickets, geography, external events (all have negligible impact)
